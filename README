Bubblo demo done at iPhoneDevCamp3 by Annika, with help from Dad

Bubblo is a simple game of chance, where you press a Play button (or
shake the device) and get either a crown (Win!) or a hairball (Lose).
The chances are 50/50.

Comment from Annika: Really fun to write. =)

Comment from dad: Some of the BOOL flags are a bit funky at the moment.
Probably could be streamlined. Note the flip view doesn't do anything...
you might not even be able to get to it in this version.
